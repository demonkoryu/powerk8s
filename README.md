# :hammer_and_wrench: powerk8s: Powerline Plugin for Kubernetes :hammer_and_wrench:

This simple plugin is designed to show the Kubernetes cluster configured
for the current context in `$KUBECONFIG`.

This is still a work in progress. It is inspired by https://github.com/so0k/powerline-kubernetes,
and intends to be a drop-in replacement as well as an improvement upon the original work.
